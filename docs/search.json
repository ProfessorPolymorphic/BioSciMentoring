    "text": "First Year Experience Course\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSpring 2023\n\n\n\nWe are currently considering a 1 credit course required of all our majors. The course would be taught by Dr. Miura. The structure and content of the course are still unknown. If we assume all incoming freshmen are required to take this class in the Fall, then we must plan for an enrollment of about 95 to 110 students.\n\n\nCURRENT STATUS: As of Fall 2023, Bio 101 is ongoing with two sections.\nOptions and questions raised by some faculty for course structure and content are listed below.\n\nCourse Structure\n\nSectionsTimingTransfersFaculty PresentationsOther Content\n\n\nShould the class be taught as one big section? This would be easier on the instructor, but few speakers or topics are likely to engage the entire group. This also makes peer engagement more challenging. Several faculty suggested sub-groups or multiple sections (by interest, by major, etc) but this is logistically challenging.\nCURRENT STATUS: The class has two sections.\n\n\nAssuming the course is required in Fall, would it also be used to inform our assignment of mentors to faculty? It would be a good vehicle for surveys to learn about the students.\nCURRENT STATUS: The class is being deployed in this way, and surveys are planned.\n\n\nSeveral faculty brought up the issue of students who change majors into one of our degrees, or transfer in after Freshman year. Do we then waive this requirement for them?\nCURRENT STATUS: Dunno.\n\n\nOne goal is to introduce the students to the faculty. However, beware the boring research lecture! Perhaps include material on career path?\nCURRENT STATUS: Discussions are broad. No boring research lectures.\n\n\nOther presentations (undergrad researchers, grad students, campus resources, etc)\nSubstantive outreach experiences from the department? Interaction to build cohort bonding. Attend a certain number of College events.\nCURRENT STATUS: These topics are being included."

We should probably remove the following faculty from our list of eligblie mentors:\n\nGinger Carney is pretty busy being Dean of the College of Science. CURRENT STATUS: Dr. Carney intends to mentor students.\nLisa Bird, Mary Oswald, and Candi Heimgartner are Senior Intstructors who do not normally advise students.\nNicole Grieshaber is research faculty.\nLarry Forney and Eva Top have emeritus appointments.\n\nThis brings us down to 24 eligible faculty with about 16 mentees each.\nIn addition, I am not sure about the following faculty members’ potential roles in the mentoring program:\n\nShirley Luckhart has a joint appointment in CALS and her mentoring effort might be deployed there.\nTanya Miura is department chair and is also slated to teach the freshman experience course.\nWhat about faculty who may have partial appointments?\n\nThis gets us to somewhere between 19 and 23 eligible mentors, meaning we should plan for between 17 and 20 per faculty member."

All of us had a mixture of advisees that aspired to careers as health professionals, researchers, technicians, and … undefined …\nNow, more than half of our students are Medical Science majors.\nSome methods for matching mentees and mentors include:\n1. Surveys and Clustering. Collect survey data from students and faculty about their academic/research interests. Use these data to cluster people into groups. Then use this information to guide (loosely or definitively) the matching process. Collecting this survey information from students would likely have other interesting applications. Obvious drawbacks include the amount of work to create and analyze the survey and controlling the response rate.\nCURRENT STATUS: Tanya is developing a survey for Bio 101.\n2. First come - First served. Allow students to sign up for the mentor of their choice. Establish a cap for each mentor. I don’t see many advantages to this system. Disadvantages include the amount of work to set up the sign up system and the “competence penalty” imposed on the faculty that have somehow resonated with lots of students.\n3. Random. Almost no work. Sometimes the simplest choice makes a lot of sense…\n4. Ranked Choice. This could be combined with option 1, but is probably a fair amount of work to set up.\nCURRENT STATUS: The survey will include some ranking by the students."

    "text": "Fluidity of Assignments\nOne suggestion that came up in almost every faculty interview was the notion of mentees changing mentors. For example, when a student joins a lab for undergraduate research, it is very likely that the supervising research mentor would become the assigned mentor. When a student discovers their passion and changes their career plans, they should be able to look for a mentor that can help them achieve their new goals."

Some important unanswered questions include:\n\nHow many hours per week is “mentoring”? This has always varied across faculty, and always will. Nevertheless, is there a minimum expectation?\nDoes everyone have to do the same thing? NO After the freshman experience class, can each mentor establish their own approach / schedule / requirements? YES\nRequired vs Optional? Are meetings required? How often? MAYBE: 1/year? How is this enforced? If they are not required, are we reaching the students that really need the help?\nHow is it tracked? Once things are required, then they need to be tracked. Who will do this? How will they do it?\nAccountability? Assessment? How do we know if the program is working? How do we know if mentors are meeting expectations? If some are not performing, is there any mechanism for accountability?\n“Credit”? How is this reflected in the position description? Is this system another unfunded mandate?\nResources?
